         <h2>Bitcoin & Wind Power, are they real?</h2>
         <p>Authorities discovered over three thousand electronic rigs used illegally by Bitcoin
            miners in an underwater dome not far from the offshore windmills that powered them
            last week.   Recreational scuba divers from the resort city of Virginia Beach 
            discovered the rigs which were using stolen renewable electricity to power the operation.
            The utility company that owns the offshore windfarm was unaware of the drain on power 
            generation since the total output was still exceeding original estimates.</p>

         <h2></h2>
         <p>The devices were seized between April and June and have an estimated value of $5.3 
           million USD. Eight people associated with the Black Manta crime syndicate were reportedly 
           arrested for being involved in mining activities using stolen electricity.  Officials 
           from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were impressed with the structural 
           complexity and design of the protective underwater dome which appeared to be built in 
           sections and assembled on site by what must have been a team of highly skilled divers.</p>

         <h2>Aquaman to assit with illegal device disposal</h2>
         <p>The confiscated devices will be disposed of by submerging them in the Puerto Rican 
            trench where the water pressure at depths of more than 8,400 meters will crush their 
            components while the salt water corrodes their circuits.</p>

         <h2></h2>
         <p>As the cryptocurrency market surged earlier this year, it brought into focus the 
            massive energy consumption in mining digital coins. The energy-intensive 
            “proof-of-work” process, through which Bitcoins are earned/generated, makes computers 
            compete to solve complex mathematical equations. Given the competitive element in the 
            quest for valuable cryptocurrency, powerful mining rigs — PCs purpose-built to 
            maximize mining rewards — are preferred by cryptocurrency miners.</p>
         
         <p>Electricity theft is a major issue in regions where Bitcoin is mined as some miners
            use illegal means to secure the power supply necessary to make a big profit from 
            cryptocurrency mining. Because of the additional pressure it puts on the electric 
            grid, authorities have to often resort to load sharing that results in regular outages.</p>

            While offshore wind power and 
            Bitcoin are real, everything else
            is fictitious and strictly for 
            entertainment.
